                "Liquity Protocol is a DeFi application that can be integrated into third-party projects or applications, such as Bankless DAO's BanklessLoans. The protocol allows users to create interest-free liquidity in LUSD (a USD pegged stablecoin) by depositing ETH in autonomous smart contracts. LUSD is stabilized by a liquidation mechanism and a Stability Pool, both are fully decentralized and smart contract based. What this means is that the Liquity smart contracts automatically and autonomously deduct technical fees which can be claimed by Liquity users. All functions of Liquity are autonomous and if something goes wrong with the contracts, there is no recourse against a private individual or legal entity. Similarly, while BanklessLoans operates the frontend interface, BanklessLoans is not responsible for issues with the Liquity contracts. BanklessLoans cannot access or control deposits or transactions initiated through the BanklessLoans frontend. BanklessLoans has no relationship with Liquity AG, Liquity, or other Liquity frontend operators. BanklessLoans does not and will not enter into any legal or factual relationship with any user of BanklessLoans beyond provision and maintenance of the frontend.",

Attacks by hackers on Liquity smart contracts or other software used may have unforeseeable consequences, including loss of deposited funds.
